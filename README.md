## Running the examples

Running the examples is really easy. The only thing you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

First, download the [ZIP archive of this repository](https://github.com/sandiindika/pyqt-gui/archive/_.zip) and unpack it. Open a command prompt and use `cd` to navigate into the top-level directory of the archive.

Create a virtual environment via the command:

    python3 -m venv venv

This creates the folder `venv/` in your current directory. It will contain the necessary libraries for running the examples.

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```
# On Windows:
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
